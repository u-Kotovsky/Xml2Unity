Script was tested in unity 2022.3.11f1

Installation: Download Assets folder and merge it with your current. Do not move or rename Xml2Unity or it's folders since it could break some stuff. (Paths are hardcoded. you still can add new libraries but needs to be added in code as well...)

To open a window go to Tools > Xml2Unity Window
To load a map from existing list hit Load xmls > Select xml from dropdown > Load map
To remove white things from existing map, put map into latest build > hit many times 'Clear bullshit'
